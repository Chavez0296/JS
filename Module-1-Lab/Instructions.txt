INSTRUCTIONS INFO
=================
Since this is your first lab, I want to describe
the various types of instructions that will be
provided for you in your future labs.

-- Instructions.txt
Every lab will include this Instructions.txt file
containing a description of the lab as well as
any instructions to follow for that particular
lab. The instructions file may also contain
relevant references, hints or other details
that will help you complete it.

-- In-line Instructions
In-line instructions are typically comments that are placed
above, below or in-between existing code and act as both
a placeholder for *where* your code should go as well as
*what* should go there. When you see in-line instructions,
assume that any code/function required should be placed
right below the in-line instruction.

=================
LAB 1 DESCRIPTION
=================
In this lab, you will use your existing HTML/CSS skills
along with the provided references to create a simple 
HTML page from scratch that is fully responsive using
the Bootstrap CSS framework. The end result will be a
page that contains various text/visual and form elements.
